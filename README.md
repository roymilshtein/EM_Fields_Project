# Electromagnetic Fields Project

This repository contains MATLAB code and supporting documents for a project dealing with electromagnetic fields, specifically focusing on two problems: calculating the charge on a disk and determining the capacity of a circular capacitor.

## Project Overview

### Part 1: Charge on a Disk
- **Objective**: Calculate the charge on a disk both mathematically and analytically using discretization methods.
- **Files**:
  - `Q1.m`: MATLAB script for the charge on a disk calculation.
  - `1B figure.fig`: MATLAB figure file related to the charge on a disk.

### Part 2: Circular Capacitor
- **Objective**: Calculate the capacity of a circular capacitor based on the distance between plates using both mathematical and discretization methods.
- **Files**:
  - `Q2.m`: MATLAB script for the circular capacitor capacity calculation.
  - `2C figure.fig`: MATLAB figure file related to the circular capacitor.
